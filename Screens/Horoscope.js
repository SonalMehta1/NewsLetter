       A horoscope is an astrological chart or diagram representing the positions of the Sun, Moon, planets, astrological aspects and   
       sensitive angles at the time of an event, such as the moment of a person's birth. The word horoscope is derived from the Greek 
       words ≈çra and scopos meaning "time" and "observer".
